# DiscordAutoForumBot
DiscordAutoForumBot is a Python script that automates posting images to a Discord forum channel. It uploads images from specified folders, creates posts with custom titles, and tracks progress to avoid re-uploading content. Built with Selenium, it handles login, post creation, and error retries for efficient automation.
